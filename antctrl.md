# dl9et's HF antenna management wishlist

* switch between 4 TX antennas
  * Hexbeam, 40m loop, something 80m/Endfed, "experiments"
  * Switch automatically by TRX band selection
  * Switch manuelly between alternatives (in the shack)
  * Switch manually between alterantives (remote)
* switch between TX/RX antenna (since my TRX has no RX ant port)
  * automatically: prevent TX into RX antenna (interlock)
  * switch RX direction (relais)
* connect antenna to SDR

## Status Quo
* Antenna Switch + (proprietary) controller
* SDR Switch
